# SnowBoarderProject2D
 Unity and C# learning project

This project's goal is to guide the snowboarder through the hills until the end of the course without hitting his head on the ground.
In case his head is hit, the game restarts. To play, we must use the keys "left arrow" to rotate the snowboarder to the left, "right arrow" to rotate the snowboarder to the right, and "up arrow" to boost the snowboarder up.

One level was developed to practice some basic functionalities from Unity and C# such as the features and methods listed below: 
><p>Transform.Translate()</p>
><p>[SerializeField]</p>
><p>Input.GetAxis()</p>
><p>Time.deltaTime()</p>
><p>Colliders and Rigidbodies</p>
><p>OnCollisionEnter2D()</p>
><p>OnTriggerEnter2D()</p>
><p>Assets</p>
><p>Follow Camera</p>
><p>Tags</p>
><p>GetComponent</p>

This is a demonstration of a player finishing the course:
